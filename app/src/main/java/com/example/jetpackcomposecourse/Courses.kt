        Are you confused from where you need to start learning coding?

        Are you a Java developer wondering if you need to learn Kotlin?

        Maybe you are an experienced Java developer who wants to learn Kotlin quickly, to be prepared for future project work.

        Perhaps instead, you're an Android app developer who knows Java well, but you want to be able to move forward with Kotlin for new Android development work.

        Because Kotlin works anywhere Java works, and can even be called from Java code (and vice-versa), this brings with it a massive opportunity for Java developers. Being able to work with both Java and Kotlin is going to give you a massive advantage over other programmers.

        In addition, the Kotlin syntax is explored in detail. Over Twelve hours of videos are included in the course, making it one of the most comprehensive courses on the language.



        Now is the perfect time for you to learn Kotlin, while it's relatively new. It has been around for a while, but only now is it being thrust into the limelight.

        It's absolutely vital for Java developers to learn Kotlin to maximize future career opportunities. Objective-C developers who failed to transition to Swift, or were too slow doing so, were left behind. Don't make the same mistake they did!
